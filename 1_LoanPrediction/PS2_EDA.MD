## **Project Description: Comprehensive Dataset Understanding**

#### **Overview**
This project is designed to help beginners gain a step-by-step understanding of how to explore and comprehend a dataset using Python and the `pandas` library. By completing this project, participants will learn the fundamental techniques required to prepare for data analysis and build a solid foundation in working with datasets.

The tasks are divided into logical buckets—loading the dataset, extracting basic information, analyzing columns, and inspecting data distribution—allowing learners to progress systematically. The focus is not on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) or visualization but on building the skills necessary to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

## Tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis

### **Main Task 1: Import and Prepare the Dataset**

This task focuses on preparing the dataset for analysis by importing the required libraries, loading the dataset, and performing initial checks such as identifying missing values and analyzing the target variable. These steps are essential for understanding the structure of the data and ensuring its readiness for further analysis.

---

#### **Sub-Task 1-1: Import Libraries and Load the Dataset**

##### **Description**  
Import the necessary libraries and load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. This step sets up the environment for data analysis and ensures the dataset is accessible.

```python
# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/train_loan_prediction.csv')  # Adjust file path as needed

# Preview the dataset
data.head()  # Display the first few rows of the dataset
```

---

#### **Sub-Task 1-2: Check for Missing Values**

##### **Description**  
Identify missing values in the dataset to assess data quality. Missing values can affect analysis and must be addressed before proceeding.

```python
# Check for missing values
missing_values = data.isnull().sum()

# Display the count of missing values
missing_values
```

---

#### **Sub-Task 1-3: Analyze the Target Variable (`Loan_Status`)**

##### **Description**  
Analyze the distribution of the target variable (`Loan_Status`) to check for class imbalance. Class imbalance can influence model performance and may require handling during model building.

```python
# Count the occurrences of each class in the target variable
target_counts = data['Loan_Status'].value_counts()

# Visualize the target variable distribution
target_counts.plot(kind='bar', title='Target Variable Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Loan Status')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()
```

---

### **Main Task 2: Numerical Feature Analysis**

This task focuses on analyzing numerical features one at a time. Each feature will undergo a series of steps to identify missing values, understand its distribution, detect outliers, and compute its relationship with the target variable.
